This is the technology blog of John Beardon. Full-time IT and Communications Manager, IT Consultant, Web Site Developer and self-confessed 'tech head'.

You may have discovered this site by links to either Ashleigh Consulting or Ashweb Creative Development. Ashleigh Consulting is a business I stillrun,but has taken a back seat since my transition back into a full time IT Management role.

The aim of this site is to showcase consultancy, support and development projects undertaken in my spare time and provide technological hints, tips and reviews based on my lengthy experience in the IT industry.
